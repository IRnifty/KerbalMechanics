This mod is in ALPHA. There will likely be bugs. The parts are not balanced. If you have a bug, or a suggestion,
please leave your feedback in a mature manner.


FEATURES:

Parts that can fail are tested based on their "reliability", which drains faster or slower, depending on the "quality".
Each module inside a part is individually tested, as an example, an engine will have up to 4 different pieces that can fail:
- The ignition coil
- The cooling system
- The gimbal motor
- The alternator (not yet implemented)

Most failures have two options for fixing. A standard fix, which will cost Rocket Parts, and a second, more silly option,
which is free, but provides a risk of further damage. The free option may need to be clicked more than once.

Engines can fail:
  - Ignition failures while throttling up from 0, or while running the engine
  - Cooling failures while the engine is running, causing increased heat production.
  - Gimbal freezes while the engine is running, reducing maneuverability of the craft.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Fix Engine".
  - The free fix has a chance to cause the part to explode.

Decouplers can fail:
  - While decoupling in any way, the decoupler may either decouple, do nothing, or explode.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Re-rig Decoupler".
  - The free fix has a chance of either decoupling or causing the part to explode. It may need to be clicked more than once.

Lights can fail:
  - Once a light has begun to fail, it will begin flickering for a few seconds, and then burn out.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Replace Bulb".
    This may be selected even while the part is working, to allow for "preventive maintenance".
