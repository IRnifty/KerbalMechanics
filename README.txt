This mod is in ALPHA. There will likely be bugs. The parts are not balanced. If you have a bug, or a suggestion,
please leave your feedback in a mature manner.


FEATURES:

Parts that can fail are tested based on their "reliability", which drains faster or slower, depending on the "quality",
which is tweakable (modifiable in the Editor by right-clicking the part).

Engines can fail:
  - Ignition failures while throttling up from 0, or while running the engine
  - Cooling failures while the engine is running, causing increased heat production.
  - Gimbal freezes while the engine is running, reducing maneuverability of the craft.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Fix Engine".

Decouplers can fail:
  - While decoupling in any way, the decoupler may either decouple, do nothing, or explode.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Bash With Hammer".
    The part may still either decouple, do nothing, or explode. "Bash With Hammer" may need to be clicked more than once.

Lights can fail:
  - Once a light has begun to fail, it will begin flickering for a few seconds, and then burn out.

  - Failures are fixed by sending a Kerbal on EVA, right-clicking on the broken part, and selecting "Replace Bulb".
    This may be selected even while the part is working, to allow for "preventive maintenance".
